This was done with the keys:
<ctrl>+ <r> <git> <enter>
After that I ls'd and used cd into lab7 via the keys:
<ls> <ctrl> + <r> <enter>

Following this I used the keys:
<ctrl>+<R> <ba> <enter>
This let me run a test to see the number of failures the code provided

Once I saw the failures from step 6 I used vim in the code with the keys 
<ctrl>+<r> <vim>
After going into the code I changed the last while statement via the keys:
<k><k><h><h><del><i><2><esc>

After that I pressed the following in order to save and exit:
<:><w><w><enter>
Then I ran the test one last time to see if they pass which they did:
<ctrl>+<r> <b> <a> <enter>
